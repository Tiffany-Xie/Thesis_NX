## Things we can do next
- Fit real-world incidence data
  - COVID 19 (Omicron Peak)
  - Measles
- Direct Interval fitting (using Gamma); GCT -> Gamma properties
- Likelihood functions for Erlang and Pseudo Erlang (GCT); and maybe fit to test the difference
- Multiple simulated data for parameter estimation (distribution)
- Makefile workflow (maybe?)
