# Proposed Title
**Within-host dynamical models of acute respiratory viruses: A review of approaches and methods**

# Readings
[Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497610/)

[Dawn Bowdish grant](https://mcmasteru365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xien6_mcmaster_ca/EgAXnNQUnjdHr5uDwCUVkucBKblk85ETDEA_jaEdvbnR2Q)

[Immune boosting bridges leaky and polarized vaccination models (our paper)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.14.23292670v2)

# Ideas
- Tropism: What do we know about how or whether tetrapods (or mammals?) have evolved various mechanisms to induce a tradeoff between viral success in lower or upper airways
- Immunity: How do we measure or define immunity? How careful are people in talking about it? We can have protection against infection, the ability to transmit, clinical disease, hospitalization, and death. How do these things wane?

**Mathy stuff:** Simulate, analyze, and fit very simple boxcar models.

# To do (Ningrui)

Let me know what you think of the SARS paper (maybe write a notes document about it on the repo and send me a link or just let me know the name)
* For now, just spend one hour consolidating your _current_ thoughts and questions ✓

Finally, let JD know thoughts about the Dawn Bowdish grant
* ~/Downloads/vaccResponseGrant.pdf ✓
* For now, just spend one hour consolidating your _current_ thoughts and questions ✓

And similarly for [our paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.14.23292670v2)
* For now, just spend one hour consolidating your _current_ thoughts and questions
* Also, work on the math and/or simulation side to see what you can learn

* Set up a oneDrive folder, share it with JD, and add the grant pdf ✓
* This one is very hard, but try to come up with some questions or thoughts
