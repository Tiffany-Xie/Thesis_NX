=================

Ningrui has checked that naive (point-based) interval densities add up very close to 1; consider normalizing inside the code anyway.
* Or maybe not worry about it for now, since we will be moving on to real interval densities

You should be doing both of these things in many cases: check that it's close _and_ normalize anyway.
