# Proposed Title
** Within-host dynamical models of acute respiratory viruses: A review of approaches and methods **

# Readings
[Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497610/)

# Ideas
- Tropism: What do we know about how or whether tetrapods (or mammals?) have evolved various mechanisms to induce a tradeoff between viral success in lower 
or upper airways
- Immunity: How do we measure or define immunity? How careful are people in talking about it? We can have protection against infection, the ability to transmit, 
clinical disease, hospitalization, and death. How do these things wane?
[A paper by us](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.14.23292670v2)

**Mathy stuff:** Simulate, analyze, and fit very simple boxcar models.

# To do (Ningrui)

- ~~ Make a repo for your thesis and share it with me ~~ (done)
- ~~ Add these notes! ~~ (done)
- Look at your "project" and "ideas" documents to see if any of that should be on the repo
- Let me know what you think of the SARS paper (maybe write a notes document about it on the repo and send me a link or just let me know the name)
