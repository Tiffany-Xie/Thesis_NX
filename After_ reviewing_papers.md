## Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
[Adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497610/)

### Points
- SARS2-specific T-cell responses are significantly associated with milder disease — T-cell responses important for control and resolution of infection.
- The inability of the innate immune system to produce effective IFN (interferon) has been closely linked to the inability to control an initial SARS2 infection.
- CD4+ T response to SARS2 > CD8+ T and has been associated with control of primary SARS2 infection.
- CD4+ T cell s had the strongest association with lessened covid19 severity (compared with CD8+ T).
- Different T and B cell reactions might result from a disconnect between B cell and T cell responses, stemming from changes in early innate immune responses. This could potentially lead to delays in kinetics or dysregulation of T cell priming.
- A practical working model suggests that the severity and duration of COVID-19 are primarily determined by the evasion of early innate immune recognition and the subsequent kinetics of the adaptive immune response.
- It’s notable that the absence of a correlation between neutralizing antibodies and recovery from covid.
- The ability to control covid without substantial contribution from neutralizing antibodies, as long as strong T cell response is present.

### Points
- Neutralizing antibodies are not a strong correlate of protection in older adults.
- Non-neutralizing antibodies and cellular immunity are the correlates of protection.
- Antibodies capable of mediating FC-mediated antibody functions such as ADP and ADCC were generated after the first dose of vaccine, possibly contributing to the production.
- Differences in antibody function may explain the protectiveness of different vaccination (studied in aim 1)
- Hypothesis: non-neutralizing antibody + cellular immune response (caused by different vaccine) + hybrid immune —> contribute to susceptibility and resistance to infection in older adults.
- Increasing the amount of antigen in a vaccine will increase immunogenicity in older adults (??).
- Having a ‘mixed’ vaccine regime is associated with an increased risk of infection (even after 4th and 5th doses) (too general?).
- Hypothesis: having had a primary series of Modern is associated with lasting differences in cellular and humor immune responses that may explain the prolonged protection (studied in aim3).
- COVID infection did not always lead to protection from subsequent infections
- The infection risk increased in the BA.5 wave in individuals who had had an infection in the first Omicron wave
- Certain SARS2 variants may increases infection risk by altering leukocyte number or function (first found)
